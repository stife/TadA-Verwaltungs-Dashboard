To optimize the provided PHP code while maintaining its original functionality, we can focus on reducing duplicated operations and improving error handling. Hereâ€™s the optimized version of the source code:
### Key Optimizations Made:
1. **Message Variable**: The post message is stored in a variable before sending. This avoids defining the same string multiple times, which can be useful if you need to change the message in the future.
2. **Error Handling Method**: Created a `handleError` function to centralize error handling. This improves code readability and reduces repetition in the catch blocks.
3. **Clear Error Message**: The error handling function allows you to modify how errors are handled in one place if you want to expand or change functionality later.

This optimized code reduces the number of operations and enhances maintainability while preserving the original functionality.
